    "\n",
    "- **Z-Test**: A z-test is used when you have a large sample size (typically n ≥ 30) or when you know the population standard deviation. It is used to test hypotheses about the population mean (μ) when the population standard deviation (σ) is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example scenario: Testing whether the mean weight of apples from a specific orchard is different from a known standard weight of apples when you have a large sample size and know the population standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-Test**: A t-test is used when you have a small sample size (typically n < 30) or when you don't know the population standard deviation. It is used to test hypotheses about the population mean (μ) when the population standard deviation (σ) is unknown and must be estimated from the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example scenario: Testing whether the mean test scores of students who received a new teaching method are significantly different from the mean test scores of students who received the traditional teaching method, where the sample size is small, and the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-Tailed Test**: In a one-tailed test, the critical region for rejecting the null hypothesis is located on one side of the probability distribution curve. It is used when the research hypothesis specifies the direction of the effect (e.g., greater than or less than). There are two types of one-tailed tests: left-tailed and right-tailed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  - Left-Tailed Test: Testing if a new drug reduces blood pressure (research hypothesis: μ < μ₀).\n",
    "  - Right-Tailed Test: Testing if a new drug increases reaction time (research hypothesis: μ > μ₀).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two-Tailed Test**: In a two-tailed test, the critical region for rejecting the null hypothesis is split between both sides of the probability distribution curve. It is used when the research hypothesis does not specify the direction of the effect, and you want to detect any significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  - Two-Tailed Test: Testing if a coin is fair (research hypothesis: μ ≠ 0.5, where 0.5 represents a fair coin).\n",

    "- **Type 1 Error (False Positive)**: Type 1 error occurs when you reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. In other words, you conclude that there is an effect or difference when there isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example: Concluding that a person is guilty (rejecting the null hypothesis of innocence) in a criminal trial when they are, in fact, innocent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type 2 Error (False Negative)**: Type 2 error occurs when you fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. In other words, you conclude that there is no effect or difference when there is.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Q4: Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bayes's Theorem**: Bayes's theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis (an event or condition) based on new evidence or information.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The formula for Bayes's theorem is:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Where:\n",
    "  - P(A|B) is the probability of hypothesis A given evidence B.\n",
    "  - P(B|A) is the probability of evidence B given hypothesis A.\n",
    "  - P(A) is the prior probability of hypothesis A.\n",
    "  - P(B) is the prior probability of evidence B.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Medical Diagnosis\n",
    "Suppose you are testing for a rare medical condition. Let:\n",
    "- P(A) be the prior probability of having the condition (e.g., 0.01, meaning 1% of the population has it).\n",
    "- P(B|A) be the probability of testing positive if you have the condition (e.g., 0.95, meaning a 95% true positive rate).\n",
    "- P(B|¬A) be the probability of testing positive if you don't have the condition (e.g., 0.05, meaning a 5% false positive rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you get a positive test result (B), you can use Bayes's theorem to update your estimate of the probability of having the condition (P(A|B)).

    "**Q5: What is a confidence interval? How to calculate the confidence interval, explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Confidence Interval**: A confidence interval is a range of values derived from sample data that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95% confidence interval). It quantifies the uncertainty associated with estimating population parameters based on samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation of Confidence Interval**:\n",
    "1. Determine the desired confidence level (e.g., 95% confidence).\n",
    "2. Collect sample data and calculate sample statistics (e.g., sample mean and standard deviation).\n",
    "3. Choose an appropriate statistical distribution (e.g., normal distribution for large samples, t-distribution for small samples).\n",
    "4. Calculate the standard error (standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size).\n",
    "5. Determine the critical value(s) from the chosen distribution for the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for a 95% confidence interval in a normal distribution).\n",
    "6. Use the formula to calculate the confidence interval:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Confidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "Suppose you want to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average height of a population based on a sample of 50 individuals. You find that the sample mean height is 170 cm, and the sample standard deviation is 5 cm. Using the t-distribution for a 95% confidence interval (t = 2.0096 for 49 degrees of freedom), you can calculate it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standard Error (SE) = 5 cm / √50 ≈ 0.7071 cm\n",
    "- Margin of Error (ME) = 2.0096 * 0.7071 ≈ 1.4193 cm\n",
    "\n",
    "The 95% confidence interval is:\n",
    "170 cm ± 1.4193 cm, which results in the interval [168.5807 cm, 171.4193 cm]. This means you are 95% confident that the true average height of the population falls within this range.\n",
